O-Car-Go
======
O-Car-Go is a 'Coding For Life' project, aimed at teaching children programming concepts through a vehicle routing game. It is a Django based web application.

To run the app, you'll need the dependencies found in requirements.txt. If you've got pip installed, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` at the top level of the project (you may need to prefix that with `sudo`). You may want to use a [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
